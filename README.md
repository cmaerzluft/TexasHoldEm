Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("cmaerzluft/TexasHoldEm")
```

To do
-----

1.  Develope code that determines how close a hand is to being made using what is available

<!-- -->

1.  for example, if someone has a 2, 3, 5, & 6. The code should say one card away from a straight

<!-- -->

1.  Develope code that figures out how many potential hands can beat the current hand using the community cards plus two unknown cards.

<!-- -->

1.  for example, if I have a straight is it possible for a higher straight to exist? or can someone make a flush with the cards in the community pile

<!-- -->

1.  Start working with the real data

<!-- -->

1.  will need to model betting - including bluffing and stuff
2.  will need to figure out how to handle censored data

<!-- -->

1.  Start exploring adversarial networks
